### Fast Refresh

React Native is a framework for building native mobile apps using JavaScript. It has been created by Facebook, which is an additional reason to consider its merits.

The React Native is open source and free to use, even if you are not a Facebook user. It allows you to create cross-platform codes that will work on Android and iOS platforms and it only requires the use of JavaScript and JSX languages that should be familiar to most web developers.

### Seamless Cross-Platform

React Native is a cross-platform solution that enables developers to create mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It combines the power and performance of the React framework with the benefits of native app development.

React Native has been gaining popularity in recent years because of its seamless cross-platform nature. Unlike other solutions, it doesn’t require developers to learn several frameworks for different platforms. Instead, they can use one technology to build for multiple platforms, which saves time and money.

### Native Development For Everyone

React Native is a library created by Facebook, which helps developers to write mobile apps using only JavaScript. It’s an open-source project that provides all of the functionality needed to create native applications for both Android and iOS. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular Android and iOS apps, like View, TextView, ImageView etc. It also has its own set of tools built on top of it like Navigator, StyleSheet etc., which are used to build the user interface.

React Native is one of the most popular frameworks for developing native mobile applications with JavaScript. A large number of companies use it because it allows developers to develop cross-platform applications with ease, while maintaining a consistent codebase across platforms. This enables them to make changes in the code once
