### When Does Your Website Need a Redesign?

Website redesign is not the answer to every problem. A redesign mainly focuses on improving the user experience and making your site easier to navigate. The main reasons for a website redesign include an outdated design, incompatibility with current web standards, or broken functionality.

Outdated design: The design of your website can be outdated because of the different styles that are popular in current designs. Updates to the latest trends will bring an old site up-to-date and make it more appealing to potential customers.

Incompatibility with current web standards: Websites are not compatible with all browsers anymore due to them being developed at different times in history. This can lead to problems when users come across your site in a browser they have never seen before or when they have disabled JavaScript.
