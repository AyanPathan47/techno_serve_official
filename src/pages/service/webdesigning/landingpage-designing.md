### What is Landing Page Design?

Landing page design is the process of developing a visually attractive, attention-grabbing landing page for any website with the express purpose of driving traffic to it.

Landing pages are not only important from a marketing perspective, they’re also important for SEO. They can be used to get higher rankings in search engines by having every post or article link back to the original landing page.

Effective landing pages are all about knowing what you want your visitors to do when they get there – which is usually signing up for an offer, downloading an ebook, or ordering a product.

### Marketing Landing Page

A marketing landing page is a webpage, designed to serve as the entry point of the customer’s journey. It is best to use a landing page when promoting products or services on social media, public relations campaigns, or SEO.

The most important thing about designing a marketing landing page is that it should be simple and straightforward. For example, if you are promoting an offer for your new product, include information about the offer in the headline and in bulleted points after this. A great way to ensure that your landing page design will not distract your customers from what they are looking for is to keep it simple with only one call-to-action button on the entire page.

### Lead Generation Landing Page

A lead generation landing page is an online advertisement that has been created for the company’s website in order to generate leads.

The landing page is typically the first point of contact that a potential customer will have with the company. It should be designed to provide potential customers with clear and relevant information about what it offers, while also providing an easy way for them to sign up for more information.
