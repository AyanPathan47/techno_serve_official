 # Responsive Web Design

### What is Responsive Web Design?

Responsive Web Design is the use of HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge a website to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones).

### How does responsive web design work?

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used in responsive web design to serve different style properties based on the screen size, orientation, resolution, colour capability, and other characteristics of the user’s device. Viewport and media queries are two examples of CSS properties related to responsive web design.

### Why responsive web design matters to web designers and business owners?

Responsive web design allows web designers, user interface designers, and web developers from working around the clock to create websites for every device on the market.

Among the advantages are the following:

**Every device has its own site:**  The website will be configured for the user’s optimal viewing pleasure, whether viewed on a 27-inch iMac with a wireless connection or from the screen of your Android phone.  
**The device’s optimal design is:**  All images, fonts, and other HTML elements will be scaled to fit the user’s screen size when using the responsive web design approach.  
**Redirections are not required:**  Other approaches to designing for multiple devices necessitate the use of redirects to direct users to the correct version of a web page. The user can access the content he wants to look at as quickly as possible because there are no redirects.  
From a financial standpoint, responsive web design is also advantageous. It’s also easier to manage because you only have to manage one site rather than two. Changes do not need to be made twice. Instead, you can update a single website from which you can work.
