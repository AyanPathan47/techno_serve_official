                    1. iCHARMS &ndash; PRO IT Reliable Support (CMS) &ndash;
                    Introduction:
                </h2>In our fast-paced world, the inextricable link between IT
                and business is now so hardwired that it is almost impossible to
                imagine one without the other. Put quite simply, if your company
                is not digitised or online 24/7, 365 days a year, then it
                probably isn&rsquo;t functioning at all. In our digital era, it
                is no exaggeration to say that a modern business can only be as
                powerful as its IT Systems. As iCHARMS is our own product
                designed and developed by us, we are in the best position to
                offer you the most reliable up to the minute complete IT support
                solutions for both the products. We are also on hand in times of
                need and can provide crucial backup and troubleshooting, as well
                as the latest cyber security to protect your data which is your
                organisations&rsquo; most precious assets.<h2><br>

                    5. Client Case Study | The difference it can make to go with
                    iCHARMS PRO &ndash; IT Reliable Support:
                </h2>In the case of CARE AND RELIEF FOUNDATION there are
                hundreds of issues that can be listed down as &lsquo;case
                study&rsquo; which I strongly believe is not needed for you to
                make a wise and informed decision. I leave this section blank,
                as noting down one of the case study won&rsquo;t do justice to
                the problems faced, efforts and technical knowledge applied to
                find a solution, solution found &ndash; mutually discussed and
                agreed and actual implementation of that solution followed by
                retesting with a confirmation from your side of a proper and
                expected outcome.<h2><br>
                    6. iCHARMS &ndash; PRO IT | Pricing Plans &ndash; Flexible
                    Fees Designed To Suit All
                </h2>We call this as &lsquo;&rsquo;The Best Investment of any
                Organisation on its assets&rsquo;&rsquo;. iCHARMS &ndash; PRO IT
                Support Services offer a simple choice of packages at fixed
                price points to give flexibility and avoid large per hour fees.
                Pricing Structure Details: The outlined pricing structure is
                specifically tailored for the inaugural year of service.
                Following the initial 12 months, CARE AND RELIEF FOUNDATION will
                seamlessly transition to a rolling monthly contract. It&rsquo;s
                crucial to note that the pricing for subsequent periods may
                undergo revisions. These revisions are contingent upon factors
                such as inflation rates and workload demands, ensuring that the
                pricing remains reflective of the evolving nature of the
                services provided. Transition to Rolling Monthly Contract: After
                the first year, CARE AND RELIEF FOUNDATION will move away from
                the fixed annual commitment and enter into a rolling monthly
                contract. This transition allows for greater flexibility in
                adapting to the evolving needs of the client while maintaining a
                consistent and reliable support structure. Deactivation Notice:
                In the event that a client wishes to deactivate their account,
                it is required to provide a minimum of one month&rsquo;s notice.
                This notice period is essential for facilitating a smooth
                transition and allows both parties to finalise any outstanding
                matters. Additionally, CARE AND RELIEF FOUNDATION are expected
                to fulfil the necessary payment obligations during this notice
                period, ensuring a proper account closure without any
                disruptions in service or support. This transparent and
                collaborative approach to pricing and deactivation procedures
                reflects our commitment to maintaining a positive and mutually
                beneficial partnership with our CARE AND RELIEF FOUNDATION.<h2><br>
