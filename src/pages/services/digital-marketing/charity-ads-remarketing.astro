              What is Remarketing?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Remarketing is one of those things that you might not know about,
              but if you’ve visited any website and then seen ads for that site
              pop up on your browsers or social media pages, then you’ve
              received a remarketing advertisement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remarketing is a digital marketing term for the practice of
              displaying online advertisements to people who have previously
              visited a particular website. Remarketing allows marketers to
              tailor ads to specific groups of people, which can be helpful for
              maintaining customer interest in a product even after they’ve left
              the original site. In recent years, remarketing has become more
              sophisticated as it has been applied to other digital platforms
              such as Facebook and Instagram.

              Standard Remarketing in Digital Marketing
            </h3>
            <p>
              Online marketers use standard remarketing to retarget users who
              have shown interest in their website. It is a valuable marketing
              technique that helps the business make more sales and increase
              customer conversion rates.
            </p>
            <p>
              The process of standard remarketing starts with the creation of a
              list of potential customers and then creating and distributing
              relevant ads to them. The ads will be shown on other websites or
              on the same site again.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remarketing is a valuable marketing technique for online marketers
              as it helps them sell their product more effectively and at higher
              rates by targeting those who have already shown interest in their
              product/service.
            </p>
            <h3 id="dynamic-remarketing-in-digital-marketing">
              Dynamic Remarketing in Digital Marketing
            </h3>
            <p>
              Dynamic remarketing means that the ad will be personalized to a
              potential customer based on their browsing history. This allows a
              business to keep an ad relevant for a customer and conduct a
              targeted search.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dynamic remarketing has been around since the 1990’s, but it has
              been largely underutilized by companies. A few years ago, Google
              introduced Dynamic Remarketing which was then adopted by Facebook
              and Twitter. it is estimated that there are more than 250 million
              people using this type of advertising on Google alone.

                        changes. Ignoring website maintenance can lead to higher
                        costs in the long run due to issues like security
