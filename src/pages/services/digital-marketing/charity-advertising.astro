              What is PPC (Online Advertising)
            </h2>
            <p>
              PPC is a form of <a href="https://qasimfarooqi.com/"
                >online advertising</a
              >. This is the most popular method of digital marketing. It’s done
              by bidding on specific keywords on paid online advertising
              networks such as Google AdWords and Facebook Ads.
            </p>
            <p>
              With PPC, businesses can pay per click (PPC) or per action (PPA)
              to promote their product or service to searchers on search engines
              and social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this method, companies can set a budget and then measure
              return on investment (ROI) by comparing statistics like how many
              visitors came to the website from social media or how many people
              clicked on an ad and then bought something from the company’s
              website.
            </p>
            <h3 id="google-ads-ppc">Google Ads PPC</h3>
            <p>
              Google ads are the most popular online advertising platform in the
              world. They cover a wide range of devices and platforms. Google
              Ads is a platform for advertisers and marketers to promote their
              products and services through different ad units, which include:
              text link, image, video, or native.
            </p>
            <p>
              Advantages: Google ads offer high quality targeting mechanisms.
              This means that users can target customers by location, language,
              specific interests, device type and more. The targeting also
              allows you to show your ads to customers based on their age group
              or gender.
            </p>
            <p>
              Disadvantages: Google Adwords requires a lot of work upfront
              before you start generating any traffic because you need to create
              an account and set up your campaigns before you start bidding on
              keywords and displaying ads.
            </p>
            <h3 id="facebook-ads-ppc">Facebook Ads PPC</h3>
            <p>
              Facebook has always been a social platform that has been used to
              create social connections. Facebook Ads is a way to use this same
              platform to acquire customers through ads based on demographics,
              interests, and behaviors. In order to do this successfully, we
              need to take advantage of all the online advertising tools
              Facebook offers us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Facebook provides advertisers with several different types of
              tools for their PPC campaigns. These include: Audience Insights
              (which allows advertisers to segment and target based on
              demographic and other data) and Lookalike Audiences (which allow
              advertisers to expand their reach by targeting people who are
              similar to those who have already liked their page).

                        PPC, or pay-per-click advertising, is a digital
                        marketing method where advertisers bid on specific
                        keywords to display their ads on search engines and
                        social media platforms. Businesses pay each time a user
                        clicks on their ad or performs a specific action, such
                        as making a purchase. PPC allows businesses to target
                        their audience effectively and measure the return on
                        investment (ROI) of their advertising campaigns.
