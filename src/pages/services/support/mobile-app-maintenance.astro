              Why care about app maintenance?
            </h3>
            <p>
              If your app is intended for external users, the following
              variables will change within a few months of its release date and
              have an impact on its performance:<br /><strong>Hardware:</strong>
              As new mobile devices are released, obsolete apps may no longer function
              properly.<br /><strong>Operating system:</strong> iOS and Android versions
              are updated every year, and apps must be updated to be compatible with
              newer versions.<br /><strong>Programming language:</strong> Apps will
              also need to be updated as the programming language evolves (Objective
              C to Swift, Java to HTML5).<br /><strong
                >Styles and designs:</strong
              > Prior to Apple and Android adopting material design, mobile UI used
              to adhere to skeuomorphic design principles. This meant that all apps’
              user interfaces had to be updated as well.<br /><strong
                >Libraries:</strong
              > Most apps rely on third-party libraries and dependencies, which change
              on a regular basis. Unless the apps are updated, they will be broken.<br
              /><strong>Usage Patterns:</strong> As your app matures, so will your
              user base, and the UI may need to be refreshed to reflect the changes.<br
              /><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> If the infrastructure on which your
              app is hosted changes (for example, self-hosted to AWS), you must update
              the app.<br /><strong>Security flaws:</strong> Apps can be affected
              by security flaws at any time, and you must update the app to fix the
              vulnerabilities.

            <h3 id="the-costs-of-app-maintenance">
              The costs of app maintenance
            </h3>
            <p>
              Now that you understand the consequences of ignoring the app
              update process, you must assess your costs.<br />The majority of
              app maintenance agreements are signed on a yearly basis. While app
              maintenance costs vary depending on the type of app and its
              complexity, there are some hard numbers you can use as a starting
              point.<br />According to Forrester, the average app development
              cost of $50000-$150000 represents only 35% of the total cost over
              a two-year period.<br />The number of updates is also on the rise:
              according to another survey, nearly 30 percent of app developers
              update their apps at least once a month.

              Monitoring and User Engagement
            </h3>
            <p>
              After you’ve launched an app and placed it on one of the mobile
              hosting platforms (Google Play or Apple Store), you should monitor
              its performance. Gather analytics, for example, to gain insights
              into what your potential users like and dislike about an app, how
              many users downloaded the app and how many abandoned it, and, most
              importantly, what the cause was.
