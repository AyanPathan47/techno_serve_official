              What Is Website Maintenance?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Website maintenance is the process of regularly checking your
              website for problems and errors, as well as keeping it up to date
              and relevant. This should be done on a regular basis to keep your
              website in good working order, to encourage continued traffic
              growth, and to improve your SEO and Google rankings.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to engage and retain customers, businesses of all sizes
              must keep their websites up to date and appealing. It’s all too
              easy for businesses, particularly startups, to cut corners and
              delegate a few tasks.
            </p>
            <h3 id="why-is-it-important-to-do-website-maintenance-">
              Why Is It Important to Do Website Maintenance?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Many new businesses already have a lot on their plates without
              having to worry about constantly checking in on their website.
              It’s tempting to buy a domain name, set up something temporary,
              and then worry about it later. Maintaining a current, healthy, and
              active website is critical for a variety of reasons.
            </p>
            <p><strong>SEO</strong></p>
            <p>
              You’ll need to keep your website updated on a regular basis if you
              want to drive traffic to it.<br />Google may even de-index your
              website entirely if it hasn’t been updated recently enough and
              they suspect it is infected with malware. To rank well in search
              results, you must keep your website updated with current content,
              news, keywords, and articles on a regular basis.
            </p>
            <p>Regular website maintenance is essential for SEO strategy.</p>
            <p><strong>Customer Attraction and Engagement</strong></p>
            <p>
              It’s critical to retain potential customers if your website is
              gaining traction and traffic. If they can’t find what they’re
              looking for, current information, and relevant content, there’s a
              good chance they’ll lose interest quickly. To make your website
              the useful tool you want it to be, make sure it’s free of typos
              and grammar errors, has all of the information a customer could
              want, and looks engaging and consistent.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
            <p>
              If you use a website building platform like WordPress or Wix, you
              must install regular software updates and security patches.
              Hackers may find it simple and appealing to find and target
              websites that have been dormant for an extended period of time.
            </p>
            <h3 id="how-much-does-website-maintenance-cost-">
              How Much Does Website Maintenance Cost?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Cost estimates vary depending on what your website is used for,
              the size of your audience, and the amount of content hosted. The
              various pricing tiers are discussed further below.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Personal Blog in Small Size</strong></p>
            <p>
              A small blog typically has little traffic and few requirements.
              This can be hosted for free on a blogging site like Google
              Blogger. It could also be self-hosted using a platform like
              WordPress, with low monthly costs for domain name renewal and
              hosting service.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Medium-to-Large Active Blog with a Large Audience</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have a blog that generates income and has a large audience,
              you will most likely want to be self-hosted with some
              customizations.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Company Website for Marketing Purposes Only</strong></p>
            <p>
              This, like the medium-large size blog, must be self-hosted, with a
              simple design template and limited content. It will require little
              upkeep due to regular updates, marketing, and backups.
            </p>

                        Website maintenance plays a crucial role in ensuring the
                        continued functionality, security, and relevance of a
                        business website. Regular maintenance helps identify and

                        performance, ultimately enhancing user experience,
