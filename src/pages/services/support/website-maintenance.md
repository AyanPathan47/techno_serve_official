### What Is Website Maintenance?

Website maintenance is the process of regularly checking your website for problems and errors, as well as keeping it up to date and relevant. This should be done on a regular basis to keep your website in good working order, to encourage continued traffic growth, and to improve your SEO and Google rankings.

In order to engage and retain customers, businesses of all sizes must keep their websites up to date and appealing. It’s all too easy for businesses, particularly startups, to cut corners and delegate a few tasks.

### Why Is It Important to Do Website Maintenance?

Many new businesses already have a lot on their plates without having to worry about constantly checking in on their website. It’s tempting to buy a domain name, set up something temporary, and then worry about it later. Maintaining a current, healthy, and active website is critical for a variety of reasons.

**SEO**

You’ll need to keep your website updated on a regular basis if you want to drive traffic to it.  
Google may even de-index your website entirely if it hasn’t been updated recently enough and they suspect it is infected with malware. To rank well in search results, you must keep your website updated with current content, news, keywords, and articles on a regular basis.

Regular website maintenance is essential for SEO strategy.

**Customer Attraction and Engagement**

It’s critical to retain potential customers if your website is gaining traction and traffic. If they can’t find what they’re looking for, current information, and relevant content, there’s a good chance they’ll lose interest quickly. To make your website the useful tool you want it to be, make sure it’s free of typos and grammar errors, has all of the information a customer could want, and looks engaging and consistent.

**Security**

If you use a website building platform like WordPress or Wix, you must install regular software updates and security patches. Hackers may find it simple and appealing to find and target websites that have been dormant for an extended period of time.

### How Much Does Website Maintenance Cost?

Cost estimates vary depending on what your website is used for, the size of your audience, and the amount of content hosted. The various pricing tiers are discussed further below.

**Personal Blog in Small Size**

A small blog typically has little traffic and few requirements. This can be hosted for free on a blogging site like Google Blogger. It could also be self-hosted using a platform like WordPress, with low monthly costs for domain name renewal and hosting service.

**Medium-to-Large Active Blog with a Large Audience**

If you have a blog that generates income and has a large audience, you will most likely want to be self-hosted with some customizations.

  
**Company Website for Marketing Purposes Only**

This, like the medium-large size blog, must be self-hosted, with a simple design template and limited content. It will require little upkeep due to regular updates, marketing, and backups.
